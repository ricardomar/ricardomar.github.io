ABSTRACT = {Background: This study aimed to compare brain asymmetry in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), and healthy controls to test whether asymmetry patterns could discriminate and set boundaries between two partially overlapping severe mental disorders. Methods: We applied a fully automated voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to assess structural brain hemispheric asymmetry in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) anatomical scans in 60 participants (SCZ = 20; BP = 20; healthy controls = 20), all right-handed and matched for gender, age, and education. Results: Significant differences in gray matter asymmetry were found between patients with SCZ and BPD, between SCZ patients and healthy controls (HC), and between BPD patients and HC. We found a higher asymmetry index (AI) in BPD patients when compared to SCZ in Brodmann areas 6, 11, and 37 and anterior cingulate cortex and an AI higher in SCZ patients when compared to BPD in the cerebellum. Conclusion: Our study found significant differences in brain asymmetry between patients with SCZ and BPD. These promising results could be translated to clinical practice, given that structural brain changes detected by MRI are good candidates for exploration as biological markers for differential diagnosis, besides helping to understand disease-specific abnormalities.},
