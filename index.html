		<p>Hi! I am Ricardo Martins, a quantitative neuroimaging research technician at the University of Coimbra (UC), working at the intersection of engineering, quantitative neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience. With a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering focused on multimodal signal processing and computational models of artificial perception in robotics, I have extended these interests and skills to the study of the human brain.</p> 
		
		<p>I am currently involved in projects analyzing brain structure and function using advanced neuroimaging techniques (PET, fMRI, MRI) at the Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research (CIBIT-UC) and the Institute of Nuclear Sciences Applied to Health (ICNAS-UC).</p>

		<p>Building on a background in Biomedical Engineering (MSc), I integrate probability and statistics, computer vision, multivariate signal and brain image processing, computational modeling, and machine intelligence to identify structural, functional, and behavioral biomarkers of brain health, disease, and treatment response.</p>


		<p>This website provides an overview of my work, including my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>, <a href="/publications">publications</a>, key <a href="/research">research topics</a>, <a href="/demos">projects and demos</a>, and <a href="/contacts">contact information</a>.</p>
