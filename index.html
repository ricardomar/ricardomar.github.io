		<p>My name is <strong>Ricardo Martins</strong>, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <strong>University of Coimbra (UC)</strong>. I hold a PhD in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>, specializing in automation and robotics, with a background in <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong> (MSc).</p>

		<p>Throughout my research career at UC, particularly in laboratories like the <strong>Institute of Systems and Robotics (ISR-UC)</strong>, the <strong>Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research (CIBIT-UC)</strong>, and the <strong>Institute of Nuclear Sciences Applied to Health (ICNAS-UC)</strong>, my work has focused on two main areas: artificial perception in robotics and neuroimaging in cognitive neuroscience. These fields converge through the use of <strong>statistical analysis</strong>, <strong>multivariate signal processing</strong>, and <strong>computational modeling</strong>.</p>
