		<p>I am <strong>Ricardo Martins</strong>, a research technician at the <strong>University of Coimbra (UC)</strong>. I hold a PhD in <strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>, specializing in <strong>automation and robotics</strong>, and an MSc in <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong>.</p>

		<p>During my PhD, my research focused on <strong>artificial perception models in robotics</strong>. Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher, I work in <strong>neuroimaging in cognitive neuroscience</strong> at UC, within the <strong>Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research (CIBIT-UC)</strong> and the <strong>Institute of Nuclear Sciences Applied to Health (ICNAS-UC)</strong>.</p>

		<p>My core training and research interests include <strong>probability and statistics</strong>, <strong>multivariate signal and image processing</strong>, <strong>computational modeling</strong>, and <strong>machine intelligence</strong>, which I apply to investigate brain function using neuroimaging (PET, fMRI, MRI).</p>


		<p>This website provides an overview of my work, including my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>, <a href="/publications">publications</a>, key <a href="/research">research topics</a>, <a href="/demos">projects and demos</a>, and <a href="/contacts">contact information</a>.</p>
